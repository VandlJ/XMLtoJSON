Its\n   head is not very large; its muzzle from the eyes down is more than a foot long, round as a stick,\n   and suddenly narrowing, being no bigger high up than it is at the mouth (which is so small that you\n   could scarcely put the tip of your little finger in it). This muzzle resembles the drone or the pipe of\n   the bagpipe, and could hardly be more curious or more monstrouse in shape. When this beast is\n   caught, it holds all four feet tight together, and thus is always leaning over to one side or the other,\n   or else it lets itself fall flat; you can't make it stand up, and you can't make it eat anything except\n   ants, which are what it ordinarily lives on in the woods. About a week after we had arrived in the\n   island where Villegagnon was staying, the savages brought us one of these coati, which, as\n   you can imagine, was greatly admired by all of us. Since all these animals are strangely defective\n   with respect to those of our Europe, I would often ask a certain Jean Gardien, of our company, who\n   was expert in the art of portraiture, to draw this one, as well as many others that are not only rare\n   but even completely unknown over here; to my great regret, however, he was never willing to set\n   himself to it.\n      (b) L\u00e9ry has described the tamandua, or lesser anteater, not what is now called the\n   coati, which is an animal closely related to the racoon.\n", "names": {"Lery_Jean_de": "Jean de L\u00e9ry"}}
